# Data Catcher

An attempt to create universal product scraper using `Scrapy`,
an open source framework for extracting data from the web.
https://scrapy.org/

The intention of this project was to create a product data scraper that could be used
universally for any "product listing" website with a minimal site specific configuration.

### Other scraping examples

In `other_scraping_examples` you can find eshop/platform specific scrapers which are using not only `scrapy` but also other modules
that are suitable for data extraction as `Selenium` or `bs4`.
